The package contains the nodes and the simulation environment for controlling a mobile robot in the Gazebo simulation environment. To launch the node, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 sim.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


This is version for the assignment 2 of R\+T2 which means that the User Interface will not be runned from here becouse will be implemented with jupyter.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Architecture and Modifications\+:}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
Now the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacego__to__point}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}} service is an action service, also we have an action client in the state\+\_\+machine node, which can start the action and delete the current goal (in this way we can stop the robot). The rest of the package is almost unchanged, it can be used the same launcher of the original code.

For this version (final assignment version) a subscriber has also been added to the topic /velocities in the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacego__to__point}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}} node, with this topic we can set the angular and linear speeds of the robot.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{User Interface\+:}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
The user interface is now on jupyter, all the commands can be sent from there

We can also see the current state and position of the robot in the feedback of the action service, for doing that just run in the terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{rostopic echo /go\_to\_point/feedback}
\end{DoxyCode}
